Great! Let‚Äôs prepare a clean, super-easy and interview-ready explanation for the topic:

> "HTTP Client in Angular (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, Interceptors)"




---

‚úÖ First: What is HttpClient?

> Angular provides the HttpClient service to send HTTP requests to a backend server (like .NET API) ‚Äî just like a browser talks to a website.



üëâ We use HttpClient to get data, send data, update data, or delete data from a server.

You need to import it:

import { HttpClient } from '@angular/common/http';

Inject it in your constructor:

constructor(private http: HttpClient) { }


---

‚úÖ 1. GET ‚Äì Fetch Data

> Example: Get list of users from the API



this.http.get('https://api.example.com/users')
  .subscribe(data => console.log(data));


---

‚úÖ 2. POST ‚Äì Create/Add Data

> Example: Add a new user



const user = { name: 'John', age: 30 };

this.http.post('https://api.example.com/users', user)
  .subscribe(response => console.log(response));


---

‚úÖ 3. PUT ‚Äì Update Entire Data

> Example: Update a user completely



const updatedUser = { id: 1, name: 'John', age: 35 };

this.http.put('https://api.example.com/users/1', updatedUser)
  .subscribe(response => console.log(response));


---

‚úÖ 4. DELETE ‚Äì Delete Data

> Example: Delete a user by ID



this.http.delete('https://api.example.com/users/1')
  .subscribe(response => console.log(response));


---

‚úÖ 5. Interceptors ‚Äì Middleware for Requests

> Interceptors are like security guards that run before/after any HTTP call.



‚úÖ Use Case:

Automatically attach JWT token

Show loading spinner

Handle global errors


üëâ Create an Interceptor:

@Injectable()
export class AuthInterceptor implements HttpInterceptor {
  intercept(req: HttpRequest<any>, next: HttpHandler) {
    const token = localStorage.getItem('token');
    const authReq = req.clone({
      setHeaders: { Authorization: `Bearer ${token}` }
    });
    return next.handle(authReq);
  }
}

üëâ Register it in app.module.ts:

providers: [
  {
    provide: HTTP_INTERCEPTORS,
    useClass: AuthInterceptor,
    multi: true
  }
]


---

‚úÖ Interview Summary (Easy Lines):

HTTP Method	Use For

GET	Getting data (read)
POST	Sending new data
PUT	Updating existing data
DELETE	Removing data


‚û°Ô∏è Interceptors: Used to modify requests globally ‚Äî like adding headers, logging, error handling.


---

‚úÖ Real-life Analogy (for interviews):

> Think of HttpClient like a delivery service:



GET: You request a pizza üçï

POST: You send a new order

PUT: You update your order (change size)

DELETE: You cancel your order

Interceptor: Like a manager who checks all orders before they go out.
